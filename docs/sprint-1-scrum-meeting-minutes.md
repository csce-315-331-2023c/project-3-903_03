# Scrum Meetings

## Sprint Planning Meeting
10/26  Zachry Building 3-5 PM

### Agenda:
- Next week deadline
- Get application hosted on a web service
- Discuss sprint 1 goals
- Assign tasks

**Summary**:
Learned a bit on how to use Cloudflare after getting our accounts set up. Connected our GitHub repo to our Cloudflare project and added a domain to see any changes pushed into the rep. Configured the hosted web application with SvelteKit, HTML, and Javascript to display basic messages. Discussed how to use Cloudflare to test our own changes to the website without committing the changes to main. Made changes to the database, adding a table for users.

Planned out our Sprint 1 goals and rough schedule of meetings after filling out the document.

## Daily Scrum
10/27 Zachry Building 8-9 AM

### Agenda
- Assign Tasks
- Work on Login functionality
- Connect website to database
- Brush up website

**Summary**
We thought these tasks would be fairly straightforward, so we all voted with confidence. There were seemingly no impeding factors so we began immediately. We didn’t think there would be any need for a new story.

Splitting up Github into different branches for group member tasks. Learned more about how to use Svelte with Cloudflare to host different pages on a site. Aaron will do the login page, Sophia will do the home screen and Brendan will do the database connection.


## Daily Scrum
10/30 Zachry Building 8-9 AM

### Agenda:
- Assign Tasks
- Work on Home page

Brendan:
- Database connection
- Svelte tutorial

**Summary**:
We decided that the current goals would be more difficult than previously thought. An impediment was that we were inexperienced with the programming languages. We had already developed story points at the beginning which we didn’t think needed to be added to.

We worked on the different pages for the site. We also discussed the progress on each page. The login page was done on the front end. The menu was done on the front end. The home page, which was assigned to Megha, was in progress.

## Daily Scrum
10/31 Zachry Building 9-11 AM

### Agenda:
- Work on Login page
- Connect website to database through API
- Add basic Login functionality
- Add basic menu functionality

**Summary**:
The current goals were thought to be achievable in a few more work sessions. There are no great impediments at this point in time. There isn’t a need to add new stories.

We are in the process of adding a database connection to the website through an API. Using several video tutorials to is helpful since we are inexperienced with SvelteKit. 

## Daily Scrum
11/3 Zachry Building 8-9 AM

### Agenda:
- Scrum meeting scheduling
- New story points
- Organize feedback from scrum master meeting

**Summary**:
The current agenda was simple to achieve. There are no impediments aside from not having the scrum master present, but this was remedied by appointing another member to gather information from the scrum meeting among other groups. We would leave adding stories for the Sprint 2 planning meeting.

*Feedback from scrum meeting.* Who owns what story front-to-back? Sprint meetings before the sprint starts. Centralized connection for code. Work on one story at a time. Every lab and class day is a meeting date. We are in the process of making queries to the database as soon as the page loads.


## Sprint Retrospective Meeting
11/6 Zachry Building 8-9 AM

**Summary**:
What went well was that we were able to get a website running with separate pages for the home screen, menu, and login screen that could be separately navigated to through a navbar. The interface included buttons that linked to external websites and also some images that were relevant to the function of the site. Each page was visually present for the user to interact with and the user could see the intended functionality. Our user studies went relatively well and we got some useful feedback from those who we surveyed. What we had trouble with was the connection to the database, which took a great deal of time to figure out how to integrate with the system. This was in part because many of us were inexperienced with Svelte and the use of APIs, however, this was remedied with members learning and experimenting on their own. Changes that can be made going forward could be a more formatted taking of meeting minutes and more disciplined scheduling of our scrum meetings. The current procedure seems quite productive as we are meeting 2 times a week for a few hours on top of the normal class time and labs. It is unfortunate that not every member is present for every meeting and lab. There are no adjustments that need to be made to the product backlog at the moment since our product backlog for the previous sprint seemed adequate and any modifications will be ironed out in the next sprint planning meeting.
