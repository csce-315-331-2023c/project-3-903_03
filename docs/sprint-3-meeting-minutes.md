## Sprint Planning Meeting
11/27 Zachry Building 8-9 AM

### Agenda:
Final Sprint Goals
    - Add seasonal item trend
    - Add remove feature in menu item/ingredients page
    - User management
    - Order management (status, modify an order, remove an order)
    - OAuth integration (make OAuth use SQL or change site in some way)
Accessibility Features
    - Translation API
    - High Contrast Option
    - Scalable text
    - potentially more

**Summary**
We consulted with the professor and TAs about the requirements of the project. Anything that could count as an accessibility feature has to be deliberate; it canâ€™t have been a feature that we found out that our development kit supported such as mobile accessibility. We decided that it would be the most convenient to do the recording for the final presentation over a Zoom call because it would be the most convenient.

## Daily Scrum
11/29 Zachry Building 8-9 AM
### Agenda:
Continue working on menu functionality
Finish the pages for the other users (administrator, guest)
Adding OAuth for user tokens on login
**Summary**
The agenda was a continuation of what we had already been working on, and it was unlikely we could finish it all by the end of the meeting.

Sophia and Megha were delegated the responsibility of creating more menu functionality and completing the screens that different categories of users would see when they logged in. Our next goal is to allow an employee (Cashier, Manager) to change the status of an order.

## Daily Scrum
12/1 Zachry Building 8-9 AM
### Agenda:
Final Sprint Goals:
    Sophia
    - Finish place order/order history functionality
    - Start on admin page
    Aaron
    - OAuth integration (make OAuth use SQL or change site in some way)
**Summary**
The agenda was more of a continuation of what we had already done. We think it is unlikely that we finish everything by the end of the meeting.

We are getting close to the end of the sprint, so we need to focus everything on finishing the things we have already started instead of opening up new tasks that will take our
attention away from them. We are getting close to finishing everything except OAuth, which is facing roadblocks in posting with an endpoint.

## Daily Scrum
12/4 Zachry Building 7-8 PM
### Agenda:
Review the requirements of sprint 3
Get feedback for minimum viable product
**Summary**
We believed it would be possible to complete the agenda items by the end of the meeting.

Our minimum viable product had most of the functional requirements. It allowed the user to login as a guest, customer, manager, administrator, or cashier locally. The only shortcoming in this area is that it is not authenticated using a third-party OAuth application. This will be continued to be worked on. Our menu was functional. The main things missing were the accessibility options we had planned to add. These will need to be added mainly for the customer side because they are the ones who will need it most.
