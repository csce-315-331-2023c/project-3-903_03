# Sprint 1 Planning meeting

Learned a bit on how to use Cloudflare after getting our accounts set up. Connected our GitHub repo to our Cloudflare project and added a domain to see any changes pushed into the rep. Configured the hosted web application with SvelteKit, HTML, and Javascript to display basic messages. Discussed how to use Cloudflare to test our own changes to the website without committing the changes to main. Made changes to the database, adding a table for users.
